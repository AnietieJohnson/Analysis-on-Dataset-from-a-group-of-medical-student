# TASK 1
## Introduction
Pivot tables are dynamic data analysis tools that unravel insights from complex datasets. They empower users to make informed decisions by transforming raw data into actionable patterns and trends, benefiting analysts, researchers, and decision-makers across industries. In week 2, my first class focused on how to create and understand pivot tables. The task at the end of the class was to work with a Medical student dataset with column headings: Student ID, Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Blood Type, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Diabetes, Smoking. The data set was filled with Blanks (empty cells within the dataset), so I filled appropriate data in by highlighting the column From the **_Home tab_**, then I clicked the small arrow beside _find & select_, I selected _Go to Special_ , selected _Blanks_, then Okay, I filled first cell highlighted with the value, then populated for the rest, I did same for each column in the Dataset.
## Task
Using the Medical Students Data, create Pivot Tables displaying the following:
- Average values for the following for Male and Females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol)
- Average Height and Weight for both Genders (in 2 decimal places)
- Number of students across the different Blood Groups
- Number of Students who smoke and those who don’t
- Number of Students who have diabetes and those who don’t

## Task Solutions
For the first question, I created the pivot table by Selecting the data range, Then from the **_Insert tab_** I choose _PivotTable_ and set it to new worksheet. For _Rows Field_ I selected gender and for _Values Field_ I selected (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol), I then set the Value field setting to average for each of the parameters in the Value field. In the screenshot below the pivot table representing this is the very first pivot table.

The second question Average Height and Weight for both Genders (in 2 decimal places), was done by creating pivot table by Selecting the data range, Then from the **_Insert tab_** I choose _PivotTable_, this time i used existing worksheet. I referenced the worksheet I had used for the first question. For _Rows Field_ I selected gender and for _Values Field_ I selected ( Height and Weight), I then set the Value field setting to average for each of the parameters in the Value field, after which i formatted the values for each gender to two decimal place. In the screenshot below the pivot table representing this is the Second pivot table to the left as highlighted by cell box.

For question 3, Number of students across the different Blood Groups, I created the pivot table by Selecting the data range, Then from the **_Insert tab_** I choose _PivotTable_ and set it to Existing worksheet,still referencing the same report sheet. For _Rows Field_ I selected Bloodgroup and for _Values Field_ I selected Bloodgroup as well, I then set the Value field setting to Count, so as to count the number of student that falls under each differing bloodgroup. In the screenshot below the pivot table representing this is the third pivot table to the left as highlighted by cell box.

For  Number of Students who smoke and those who don’t, I created the pivot table by Selecting the data range, Then from the **_Insert tab_** I choose _PivotTable_ and set it to Existing worksheet,still referencing the same report sheet. For _Rows Field_ I selected Smoking and for _Values Field_ I selected Smoking as well, I then set the Value field setting to Count, so as to count the number of student that have yes for smoking and those with No for smoking. In the screenshot below the pivot table representing this is the second pivot table to the right as highlighted by cell box.

For Number of Students who have diabetes and those who don’t, I created the pivot table by Selecting the data range, Then from the **_Insert tab_** I choose _PivotTable_ and set it to Existing worksheet,still referencing the same report sheet. For _Rows Field_ I selected Diabetes and for _Values Field_ I selected Diabete as well, I then set the Value field setting to Count, so as to count the number of student that have yes for diabetes and those with No for diabetes. In the screenshot below the pivot table representing this is the third pivot table to the right as highlighted by cell box.
